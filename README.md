# mini_project_1
Repo for COMP472 - the GANs - first mini project

The project can be run with the Python Notebooks, which are located in the notebooks repository. 

The files are named as Task #.pynb

There are also Python files in the Python folder that contain the code sections of the notebooks. These may by more complex to run, because the proper dependencies need to be installed. It is understandible that the Python files can be used in order to see only the code or to run the code outside of a notebook.
