The metric that is best suited to this dataset/task is Accuracy. Accuracy is the percentage of instances of the test set the algorithm correctly classifies. The instances of each of the 5 classes have been already catagorized and provided to us. When we run the counter on step 2, we accurately predicted the total instances of each of the classes. Based on the barchart we generated, we can see the distribution of the instances of each of the classes. Sports has the highest record of instances. Business has almost the same number of instances as Sports.Number of instances of Tech and Politics are close to each other. Lastly, Entertainment has the lowest record of instances.The classes seemed somewhat balanced based on this pre-analaysis.

(b) The performance of the steps (8-10) are about the same than those of step 7 becauses of the fact that instances of each of the 5 classes have been already catagorized and provided to us. If we look at the precisions, recall and f1-measure of step 7 and step 8-10, we can notice that their values are very close to 1 even though we altered the Multi-nominalNB default value and smoothing on the test set. Values close to 1 indicates balance. We can also see that the accuracy, macro avg and weighted avg and more are mostly of the same value and very close to 1 for the mentioned steps above. Sports and Business had the most precision for the steps mention (7-10) and Sports and Politics the highest recall. All these metrics helped us accurately test our model and its predictions.
